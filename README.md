This is the game Hunt the Wumpus! The goal of this game is to
find and kill the hidden wumpus before he kills you first. 
The wumpus is a big smelly creature that the hunter cannot see.
With a bow an arrow the hunter must find the wumpus and slay it
without the wumpus eating the hunter first.

# :video_game: Rules of the Game:

- The hunter moves using the w,a,s,d.
- If the spacebar is hit it arms and unarms the wumpus, the next w,a,s,d hit after that shoots in that direction.
- If the wumpus is hit it dies and you win. If you miss you are then unarmed again, and if you walk into the wumpus you are eaten and lose.
- Beware, the wumpus takes a random location every time the game is played.
